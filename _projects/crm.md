This project is part of the Fitzwilliam Museum's digital transformation process and began before I joined them; however it had stalled several times at tendering stage.

After a rigorous tendering exercise carried out over 2019, we selected Tessitura from a short list of 3 companies and they began work with the Museum in October 2019.

Within this project, we will be delivering:

* Fund raising
* Ticketing
* Event management
* Resource management

This is aimed to be delivered fully by Q2 of 2020.
