This research project is looking at the effectiveness of different touching deterrent methods used for the collections on open display at The Fitzwilliam Museum.

It is understood within the conservation sector that touching can have a detrimental effect on materials and accelerate deterioration. There is a lively and active discussion in the conservation and museum sector about what can be done to offer increased access to collections while not compromising conservation principles.

There is much anecdotal evidence of which methods are more effective than others. Further insight can be gained by looking at the frequency of touching, the type of visitor, the gallery environment, whether some types of collection are touched more than others (e.g. furniture, sculpture, religious) and the variety of deterrent methods already in use.

Understanding the efficacy of deterrence methods would allow for a more informed approach to displaying objects. Through this research, we hope to improve protection for the collections from wear & tear caused by touching, whilst maintaining curatorial integrity, visitor enjoyment and education.

Helena Rodwell, Assistant Conservator (Collections Care) will be facilitating this project in order to gather knowledge from staff and volunteers, as well as obtain quantifiable data through observation in the galleries and engaging with visitors on the topic.

There may be volunteering opportunities within the scope of this project. Any roles will be offered through the University of Cambridge Museums website.
