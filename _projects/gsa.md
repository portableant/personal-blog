As part of the British Museum's failed attempt at digital transformation, we embarked on the installation of an 'enterprise' search solution from Google - their now defunct yellow boxes - the Search Appliance. This project cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, but ultimately was not the solution that they needed. I took this on after I returned from paternity leave in 2015, with the brief that this system was to replace the aging and failing Collection Online (still not replaced in 2019!) Unfortunately, GSA is a pretty limited system - a directory of page links with some meta data - so the fabulous team at ECS had to think of a solution that got round these limitations.

The project was ultimately derailed by the Information Services division of the Museum being unwilling to support it in the workplace and blame for its procurement being passed around.
