Yesterday at the Museum of Classical Archaeology, I led a session to teach members of the public how to create 3D models using Structure from Motion. 20 people attended and I hope enjoyed and learnt new things. The training materials for the workshop are on&nbsp;[Github pages](https://universityofcambridgemuseums.github.io/festivalOfIdeas/)&nbsp;and some of the models are now going online, for example&nbsp;[Greg Painter](https://sketchfab.com/GregPainter)&#8216;s below.&nbsp;

I will probably be doing more of these workshops over the next year or so. So if you&#8217;re interested, look out for details.
