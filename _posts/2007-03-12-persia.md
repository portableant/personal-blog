After a few months of on-off work, I've finally finished the British Institute of Persian studies [website](http://www.bips.ac.uk "BIPS new website"). It has taken a bit longer than I expected as we've had to get comments from various stake holders on the committee of the Institute. I'm actually quite pleased with it and I'm getting more pleased with textpattern as a web content management platform all the time. I've also started using a vitual server at oneandone which seems pretty good value for around Â£19 pcm.

The website has two domains, bips.org.uk and bips.ac.uk (we're not totally sure about future directions for this.) Any feedback on this gratefully received. Now onto the ICOMON website which will be trilingual. Bit less time to do this one though! Maybe I'll burn a candle as usual from both ends and the middle (I'm also working on some Iron Age data at work at present; but that is a secret...)
