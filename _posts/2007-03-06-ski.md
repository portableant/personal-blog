Just got back from 7 days of skiing in the Alpine resort of Serre Chevalier. I've now managed to come down red runs after 10 days of practice; they're hard man! An interesting trip with loads of snow and some strange concoctions called Dr Pepper.

Stu Ervine took some great photos, and they can be seen on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartervine/sets/72157594567088213/ "Stu's photos").
