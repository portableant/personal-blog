I&#8217;ve just been migrating this site and a few others across to a new server. I&#8217;m also retrieving content that I had left in draft, so some dates of posts might be slightly out of sync. I&#8217;ve also updated mine and Kate&#8217;s flickr sets as well.

I&#8217;m now using a virtual server hosted by One and One instead of their cheaper and less specified business solution. Not bad, though the Plesk interface is a bit naff.
