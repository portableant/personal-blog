Welcome to my online home! I'm Daniel Pett and I work in museums and heritage and this site documents what I try to do and how I do it. I'm currently working at the University of Cambridge for the Fitzwilliam Museum as their Head of Digital and IT. Over the last year, I've been lucky enough to have worked in Abu Dhabi, Canberra, Washington DC, Tokyo and Kyoto at some brilliant museums and universities.

Here, you will find background to the projects on which I have worked, with links to papers, code, images, 3D models, open access resources and some sporadic or erratic blogging. My work is quite wide ranging, I don't think I'm an expert in anything.

This is built on the Jekyll engine and hosted on Github pages and uses a modified version of the Daemonite CSS library (built on Bootstrap 4.) I generally try to share everything I do under an open license (when possible) and I encourage others to reuse my work and improve it.

If you want to get in touch, I'm easy to find on social media...
