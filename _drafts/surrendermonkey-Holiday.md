I'm on leave from the British Museum at the moment, so I am using it to do something more useful. So I've been surfing the web, looking for a car to buy (at the moment it is looking like a second hand Lotus Elise), a new house (bored with mine) and avoiding doing work as I get tempted whilst out of office!I've just got back from the Loire valley, where I managed to find some decent white wine, some cheap champagne and some rather nice method traditionelle Vouvray. I also might have got snapped speeding near Calais (although the cameras can't get you here until next year.) Whilst I'm on the subject of France. What sort of place has supposedly 24 hour petrol pumps that are unmanned and don't let you use overseas credit cards? I'll let you work that one out.

Holiday is stacking up at the moment, I've accumulated 58 days over the last couple of years, and I'm going to make use of it this time. Off to Libya to partake in some Roman ruin viewing during November, New Year in Herefordshire, February skiing in France and then who knows. That's still around 40 days to use. Perhaps I should work 2 day weeks for a bit. Next challenge Bank Of England rugby this Saturday.
