I became a technology geek by accident after studying Archaeology at UCL and Cambridge (where I grew up partially &#8211; the rest was done in London at Uni).

I've now been working for the British Museum as an ICT advisor for over a decade, which basically means I have a vague job title allowing me to do more than a job description allows.

I write websites, manage databases, attend far too many meetings, write policy documents, discuss archaeology and have high brow conversations with various academics. Â I am also an Honorary Lecturer at the institute of archaeology at UCL and a trustee of the Palestine Exploration Fund.

Before that I worked for a couple of years at a German Investment bank, based at Bank and called Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (it was DK Benson when I joined.) I also did lots of temp work for Addenbrookes hospital and BT in their chief executive's office.

So I have now been working for 11 years since university. Scary. Other than work, I play lots of rugby &#8211; I moved clubs a bit, but I have represented for Shelford, Cambridgeshire, Eastern Counties, University College London, Harlequins, Saracens, Bath Invitation, Cambridge University, London University, London Division students, London Irish, Penguins, Hampstead, St Edmund's College (Cuppers winners) and currently Rosslyn Park.
