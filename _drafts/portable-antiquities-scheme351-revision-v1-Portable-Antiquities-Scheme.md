The Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) has been a flagship project for the British Museum since early 2003, when the Heritage Lottery Fund provided funding to take a pilot project from start up phase to a national project. I joined from working in the Equities IT division of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein to lead on their digital and ICT projects in April 2003, and worked on this project until March 2015 before moving to a new role in the British Museum.

The PAS encourages the voluntary recording of archaeological objects that the public record in England and Wales, and the mandatory recording of objects that meet the provision of the Treasure Act. All of these objects are recorded on a database that I developed from an earlier version built by Oxford ArchDigital (2003 &#8211; 2006) on open source principles and this can be seen at https://finds.org.uk/database
