One of the first projects that I was assigned after returning from shared parental leave, was the management of the delivery of the museum's implementation of Google Search Appliance (GSA) by Extended Content Solutions. This product was selected and procured by the head of Digital and the head of Information Services, and was one of the highest value systems that the museum deployed during the period that Digital and Publishing existed.

GSA was meant to be a replacement for the Museum's ageing Collection Online System, but soon after taking this on, it became apparent that the GSA was not able to fulfil this by itself as it was just an interface that pointed the user to a webpage and was not a content management system.
