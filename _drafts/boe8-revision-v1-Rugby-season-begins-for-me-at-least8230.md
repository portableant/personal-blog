Hampstead took on Bank of England at their palatial HQ on Saturday, and with a rather makeshift pack we managed to win 22 &#8211; 17 courtesy of a last minute converted try. I'm suffering today as we were under alot of pressure at scrums, regularly retreating several metres. We did however manage 5 against the head, mainly due to ponderous hooking by my opposite number.I hadn't planned to play much this year, but the team was desperate so I played.

A couple of seasons ago, Bank were quite a force. I guess either visas ran out or they have all decamped to London South Africa, totseins. Nice to finally beat them at their place.

Reading the paper today, Bath and Northampton seemed to have been winding each other up. Or at least that's what a crowd member alleged. Neither side seemed to hear the racial abuse, mystifying&#8230;. Harks back to the supposed racial abuse of Epi Taione of Newcastle a couple of seasons ago. We'll have to wait and see what happens there. I have a feeling not much will come of it.

I was going to venture to the not so delightful wilds of Watford to watch Saracen's give a debut to Andy Farrell; decided not to as tickets are extortionate. They thumped Newcastle, so I didn't miss much.

No rugby next weekend&#8230;.
