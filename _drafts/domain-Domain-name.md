Well it is taken from TE Lawrence&#8217;s manuscript about the Arab revolt during the Great War. Our family holds an early edition of this book, and I&#8217;ve always loved the volume and it has so much relevant material for the modern world. I recently acquired a Belgian film poster of the 1962 Lean masterpiece which now has pride of place at my mansion flat in Docklands. If you&#8217;ve seen the film, then you&#8217;ll know where the tag line comes from as well then&#8230;..
