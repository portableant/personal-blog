Well I've had this domain for rather along time now, and so far it's just been my experimentation zone. It holds test websites, my [photo collections](http://www.7pillarsofwisdom.co.uk/gallery/ "Gallery of images") and various Content management systems that I'm trying out; they are all developed on php.

However, it is probably now time to get it working properly and use it for something useful. Well, maybe not&#8230;

So what's been going on recently, well my brother has decided to get married, more fool him and it was a good day out. Catholic Mass followed by huge reception, followed by boozy party.
