As Kate and I have now moved into a house in Battersea, she is now allowed a cat. It is something she has wanted since her last kitty Bertie died a few years ago. We went to Battersea Cats and Dogs home with James and chose a stray called Tommy Boy. He's a short haired tabby cat, about two years old and he had to be renamed. Now, I wanted to call the cat either Bastard, Satan or just Cat; Kate was against this, so we used a classical name. We went through the Mythological characters and finally settled on the name Pericles, the great Athenian general and man behind the Parthenon.

He's now settled in to the house, but has picked up a bit of a sniffle and is currently hiding under the dresser. Hopefully he'll be out and about soon.
